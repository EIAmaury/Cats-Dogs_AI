# Machine learning for classification

### Description.

The project aims to develop a robust classification system that can accurately distinguish between images of dogs and cats.
This task may seem simple to a human, but it is a fascinating challenge for a computer. 
Indeed, the variability of poses, colours, breeds and environments in which dogs and cats can be photographed makes this classification particularly complex.

To achieve our goal, we will use convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These networks are inspired by the way the human brain works and are particularly effective at extracting relevant features from images.
